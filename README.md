# Computer Vision Projects

### Shape Detection
- Detection of simple shapes (circles, squares, triangles)

### Human Feature Detection
- Detection of facial features with the use of Haar-like filters (size and type customizable)

### Panorama using Image Stitching
- Use of SIFT keypoints detection to stitch images together to form a panorama

### Depth Map Estimation
- Estimate depth of image objects (using pair of rectified/unrectified images) using MRF and multiple label graphcuts in PyMaxflow library.
