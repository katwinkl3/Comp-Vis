    "#### Choice of Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose the cv2 library to draw a contour over potential shapes and this is done through a topological analysis of digitized binary images, thus making it one of the more efficient solutions. To maximize accuracy, the images should be as clean as possible, so that background noise will not be identified as shapes. This is done through morphological transformation that processes binary pixels against their neighbours to 'close' gaps and 'open' up shape links. However, the denoising is not perfect; many of the images still retain severed lines/dots after the processing. Hence, a threshold is defined to eliminate shapes that are too small to avoid non-shapes. The downside to this is that smaller shapes will be ignored. The threshold thus serve as a control for false positive vs false negatives. If cleaning was more properly done, this will not be needed. Alternatively, instead of making use of size, we can check whether the shape detected is solid, in other words, if its center pixels have the same color as its perimeter. I have not yet found a good way of dealing with this while using cv2.findContours. Another approach I have considered is to use a gaussian blur to remove the noise, but this will compromise the struture of the shapes, leading to more than expected number of edges. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Alternative Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thought that came to mind for shape detection is to use image gradients to detect the directions of each shape. Feature detection algorithms like SIFT might be considered but I am not sure of its performance on binary images. For a brief moment, I did consider using neural networks but that seemed slightly excessive since that will require a lot of data and images with pure shapes will need manual generation and that seems like a lot of work. Also, since shape detection ultimately have some underlying maths explanation (circles have ~10 edges approximated, while squares have 4, or squares have 90 degress slants while triangles have <90 degree slopes), it might be better to uncover these using algorithms than NNs. \n"
